# Typeix
Typeix is nodejs framework for typescript

* This is an dev design (sketches) version of typescript nodejs framework implementation.
* [Appix](https://github.com/igorzg/appix) is an new javascript version, fully workable one.
* Soon I will continue working on implementation of typescript typeix version.
